                    <p>We specialize in fine art archival pigment printing (also known as giclée printing). We use pigmented aqueous inks that provide the perfect combination of exceptional permanence (longevity) and the widest color gamut.  <br>

                    Our printers are calibrated and color managed to exacting standards of accuracy. Incredibly fine droplets of ink result in  unsurpassed detail, smooth natural gradations, and excellent tonality.

                    <p>
                        We use acid free papers and media with invisible micro ceramic coatings that help the ink stay sharp and maximize bold colors and depth. The result is vivid, true colors with deep blacks and amazing contrast.
                        
                        We make prints on a wide variety of paper types and archival substrates including beautiful matte photo papers textured natural fibers, darkroom worthy baryta papers, high gloss photo papers, rice papers, canvas, linens, and acrylic face mounted prints.
